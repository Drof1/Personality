The British boxer survived the onslaught, however and landed a sweet straight left that visibly rattled Golovkin.\r\n\r\nGolovkin kept up the pressure in the second, refusing to allow Brook to settle, but a superb uppercut stunned GGG and the Sheffield man ended the round on top.\r\n\r\nClearly stung by Brook’s impudence, Golovkin stormed out of the blocks in the third, unleashing a string of body shots that seemed to take the wind out of his opponent.\r\n\r\nTo his credit, Brook battled back and caught Golovkin with some quick sharp shots from unorthodox angles.

When you’re in a fight I see every moment, and I saw his legs buckle a couple of times.\r\n\r\n“But I hurt him. I take nothing away from him because he’s a scary champion, but I would like to fight him again. My eye stopped me coming forward.\r\n\r\n“I am a warrior and I wanted to carry on. You would have to kill me to take me out.\r\n\r\n“I was starting to get into it, but we knew how hard the first few rounds were going to be.

He didn’t hurt me at all. There were a lot of punches, but I didn’t feel them. I respect Kell. And thanks to his corner.\r\n\r\n“I’m a boxer. So now I want a unification fight. I would absolutely come back to the UK to fight, and I would like to fight Billy-Joe Saunders for his belt. But I am open to everybody,” the victor said.\r\n\r\nBrook appeared to be devastated by the loss of his own unbeaten record and expressed unhappiness with his mentor’s decision to pull him out of the fight.\r\n\r\n“He can obviously punch, but I expected him to be a bigger puncher,” said Brook.\r\n\r\n“In the second round he broke my eye-socket, but I was seeing three or four of him so it became very difficult.\r\n\r\n“I was settling into it and throwing some good punches, but when you’re seeing three or four, it is hard.\r\n\r\n“Believe me, I hurt him. When you’re in a fight I see every moment, and I saw his legs buckle a couple of times.\r\n\r\n“But I hurt him. I take nothing away from him because he’s a scary champion, but I would like to fight him again. My eye stopped me coming forward.\r\n\r\n“I am a warrior and I wanted to carry on. You would have to kill me to take me out.\r\n\r\n“I was starting to get into it, but we knew how hard the first few rounds were going to be. So you will have to talk to my coach to understand that.”\r\n\r\nA post-fight scan confirmed Brook’s fears, and he will undergo an operation to repair the damaged eye socket on Monday.', 1, '2016-09-11 16:09:13', '/images/10.jpg', 1, 6, 'PhotoReportPublication'),

(1, 'Sport', 'Sport (UK) or sports (US) are all forms of usually competitive physical activity or games which,[1] through casual or organised participation, aim to use, maintain or improve physical ability and skills while providing enjoyment to participants, and in some cases, entertainment for spectators. Usually the contest or game is between two sides, each attempting to exceed the other. Some sports allow a tie game; others provide tie-breaking methods, to ensure one winner and one loser. A number of such two-sided contests may be arranged in a tournament producing a champion. Many sports leagues make an annual champion by arranging games in a regular sports season, followed in some cases by playoffs. Hundreds of sports exist, from those between single contestants, through to those with hundreds of simultaneous participants, either in teams or competing as individuals. In certain sports such as racing, many contestants may compete, each against all with one winner.', 2, 1),
(2, 'Politics', 'Politics (from Greek: πολιτικός politikos, definition "of, for, or relating to citizens") is the process of making decisions applying to all members of each group. More narrowly, it refers to achieving and exercising positions of governance — organized control over a human community, particularly a state. Furthermore, politics is the study or practice of the distribution of power and resources within a given community (a usually hierarchically organized population) as well as the interrelationship(s) between communities.', 1, 1),
(3, 'Science', 'Science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe.\n\nContemporary science is typically subdivided into the natural sciences, which study the material universe; the social sciences, which study people and societies; and the formal sciences, such as mathematics. The formal sciences are often excluded as they do not depend on empirical observations.[4] Disciplines which use science like engineering and medicine may also be considered to be applied sciences.[5]\n\nDuring the Middle Ages in the Middle East, foundations for the scientific method were laid by Alhazen in his Book of Optics.[6][7][8][9][10] From classical antiquity through the 19th century, science as a type of knowledge was more closely linked to philosophy than it is now and, in fact, in the Western world, the term "natural philosophy" encompassed fields of study that are today associated with science, such as astronomy, medicine, and physics.[11][nb 3] While the classification of the material world by the ancient Indians and Greeks into air, earth, fire and water was more philosophical, medieval Middle Eastern scientists used practical, experimental observation to classify materials.[12]\n\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries, scientists increasingly sought to formulate knowledge in terms of laws of nature. Over the course of the 19th century, the word "science" became increasingly associated with the scientific method itself, as a disciplined way to study the natural world. It was in the 19th century that scientific disciplines such as biology, chemistry, and physics reached their modern shapes. The same time period also included the origin of the terms "scientist" and "scientific community," the founding of scientific institutions, and increasing significance of the interactions with society and other aspects of culture.', 2, 1),
(4, 'Art', 'Art is a diverse range of human activities in creating visual, auditory or performing artifacts (artworks), expressing the author\'s imaginative or technical skill, intended to be appreciated for their beauty or emotional power.[1][2] In their most general form these activities include the production of works of art, the criticism of art, the study of the history of art, and the aesthetic dissemination of art.\n\nThe oldest documented forms of art are visual arts, which include creation of images or objects in fields including painting, sculpture, printmaking, photography, and other visual media. Architecture is often included as one of the visual arts; however, like the decorative arts, or advertising,[3] it involves the creation of objects where the practical considerations of use are essential—in a way that they usually are not in a painting, for example. Music, theatre, film, dance, and other performing arts, as well as literature and other media such as interactive media, are included in a broader definition of art or the arts.[1][4] Until the 17th century, art referred to any skill or mastery and was not differentiated from crafts or sciences. In modern usage after the 17th century, where aesthetic considerations are paramount, the fine arts are separated and distinguished from acquired skills in general, such as the decorative or applied arts.\n\nArt may be characterized in terms of mimesis (its representation of reality), expression, communication of emotion, or other qualities. During the Romantic period, art came to be seen as "a special faculty of the human mind to be classified with religion and science".[5] Though the definition of what constitutes art is disputed[6][7][8] and has changed over time, general descriptions mention an idea of imaginative or technical skill stemming from human agency[9] and creation.[10]\n\nThe nature of art, and related concepts such as creativity and interpretation, are explored in a branch of philosophy known as aesthetics.', 3, 1),
