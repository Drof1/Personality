It reportedly promised rebels a right to retaliate.|Washington has called on the Syrian armed opposition to stick to the milestone US-Russia deal, calling on militants to part ways with Al-Nusra or face repercussions, a letter written by the US special envoy to Syria said. It reportedly promised rebels a right to retaliate.
Addressing unspecified “armed Syrian opposition factions,” Michael Ratney wrote that the US is awaiting a “confirmation” from rebels that they are “ready to commit” to the Friday agreement. It hails the breakthrough deal struck by US and Russia on Friday as the “best way” to decrease the number of casualties. The letter, which is in Arabic, was seen by AFP and Reuters.
The ceasefire, which the deal implies must begin on September 12 and last for at least 7 days to hold, promises to be “more effective” than in similar agreements in the past, Ratney argued, commending a clause prohibiting Syrian air forces to conduct combat missions in certain areas controlled by opposition fighters.

If such raids, carried out either by Syrian or Russian planes, do take place, the rebels will be eligible to mount counter-attacks in self defense, said the letter, according to Reuters.
The diplomat also strongly cautions rebels against siding with Fateh al-Sham, the result of a recent Al-Nusra Front rebranding, adding that those who ignore the warning will have to deal with “dire consequences.”  

While the separation of so-called moderate rebels from hardline militants like former Al-Nusra is considered to be one of the cornerstones of the deal, the reaction from a representative of the Turkey-backed Free Syrian Army (FSA), the leading rebel military force, suggests this task is hardly enforceable. 

“Fateh al-Sham is a faction present on the ground and it takes part in most of the military operations, and the matter of separating it is not possible, particularly given that there are attempts to merge, within some factions, with Fateh al-Sham,” Fares al-Bayoush, commander of the FSA unit “Northern Division” said, as cited by Reuters.

Meanwhile, another FSA official, legal adviser Osama Abu Zeid, said that the implementation of an envisaged truce depends on the actions of the Syrian government, which, he claimed, violated previous ceasefires by attacking the “moderate opposition under the pretext of fighting Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL).”

Abu Zeid told RIA Novosti that the rebels are ready to uphold the deal on their end but there was no “optimism” about the ceasefire holding.

The Saudi-backed High Negotiations Committee, which represents over 30 opposition groups and individuals, welcomed the deal, with one member, Bassma Kodmani issuing a statement calling Russia’s ability to influence the Syrian government a key, on which its viability is dependent.
“We welcome the deal if it is going to be enforced. What if Russia doesn’t pressure the regime, because that is the only way get the regime to comply,” she wrote, adding that the group is “absolutely in favor of it [the deal]”

For its part, Syrian government has already committed to the demands of the deal.

&quot;The Syrian government has approved the agreement, and a cessation of hostilities will begin in Aleppo for humanitarian reasons,&quot; the country’s state-run SANA news agency reported on Saturday.
Russia has guaranteed the compliance of Syrian authorities with the terms of the agreement. Speaking at a press-conference after 14 hours of marathon talks on Friday, Russian FM Sergey Lavrov announced that Syria’s leadership“is ready” to implement the agreements in full. While stressing that Russia, on its part, “will do everything which depends on us,” he pointed out that some parts of rebel forces have been refusing to cooperate in the peace process, instead disrupting Russia’s efforts to supply humanitarian aid to Aleppo by threatening its convoys. 

&quot;The convoy was ready to go on August 26. But the opposition said that any convoy going down the Castello highway will be shelled,&quot; the Russian FM said.

Kerry also underscored the role of Russia in ensuring the truce, saying that Washington “is going extra mile” by agreeing on the deal as it believes that Russia has “the capability to press the Assad regime to stop this conflict and to come to the table and make peace.”|2016-09-11 19:01:53|4

Libyan conflict
Colonel Ahmad Mesmari, a Libyan National Army (LNA) spokesman, reported that LNA forces had taken control over the ports of Ras Lanuf and Al-Sidra on Libya’s Mediterranean coastline to the east of the capital, Tripoli, Libya’s Lana news agency said on Sunday.

“Our armed forces took control of the entrances to [the town of] Ajdabiya, Al-Sidra port, industrial and residential area [nearby], Ras Lanuf port. Clashes are now ongoing near the Zuwaytina site,” which is east of the other two, the spokesman told the news agency.

Citing another army representative, Sputnik news later reported that the forces had also taken the port of Al-Brega, as well as 80 percent of the Zuwaytina oil site. The representative told the news agency that the army’s advance had been met with support from local residents.

A port engineer confirmed that LNA commander General Khalifa Haftar’s forces had entered the ports, while reporting that one of the oil tanks at Al-Sidra had been set ablaze during the confrontation, Reuters news agency reported.

The two ports have been closed since late 2014 due to attacks by Islamists. Both had, until recently, been under the control of the Petrol Facilities Guard (PFG), an armed group broadly supportive of the GNC, which struck a deal with the Tripoli-based government in July so that it could reopen the ports and resume oil exports. General Haftar justified seizing the oil parts by branding the PFG as an “illicit force.” Haftar, a prominent Libyan military commander, has refused to endorse the UN-backed Government of National Accord and has been actively working to prevent it from extending its authority across Libya. He and his army are loyal to the Council of Deputies, a rival administration based in the eastern city of Tobruk.

The two ports are capable of processing some 700,000 barrels of oil per day and the soil surrounding them is rich in oil. Reviving Libya’s oil trade is commonly viewed as a way to salvage the country’s economy, with hopes that the revenues would provide a vital source of income for the Tripoli-based government.

Libya has been struggling to regain political stability since a 2011 uprising that led to the ouster of the country’s longtime dictator, Muammar Gaddafi, and rival powers and militias have been fighting for control over the country ever since. In December of 2015, a UN-brokered Government of National Accord and a Presidency Council were created in an attempt to return stability and peace to the country. Yet it has been difficult for the fledgling Tripoli-based government to assert authority over the country, which is still home to a number of rival factions that oppose it.|2016-09-11 19:03:30|6

The nanofish is made of gold and nickel parts linked by silver hinges. The “head” and “tail” are made of gold, while the “body” is made of nickel. Each segment is about 800 nanometers long (a nanometer is one billionth of a meter), The New Scientist media outlet reported.

How does it work?

An oscillating magnetic field is applied to make the nickel parts move from side to side, in turn swinging the head and tail and creating movement – essentially, swimming. The magnetic field can also be used to set a specific direction for the nanofish.

The research behind the amazing fish was headed by Jinxing Li at the University of California, San Diego, who is now looking for applications for the tiny swimming invention, particularly medical uses.

“We believe they could be useful for medicine delivery, non-invasive surgery, and single cell manipulation,” Li said.

Other scientists like the idea, too, but aren’t overenthusiastic – there’s still plenty to do to make the fish useful.

“This is an exciting new idea. A lot of work on drug delivery vehicles relies on the body’s transport systems to move the particles to the site of the pathology,” Justin Gooding of the University of New South Wales, Australia, told The New Scientist.

“However, active transport has recently begun to be explored and this work shows that active transport particles can be made smaller and faster,” he added.

Another issue with nanofish is that it isn’t yet clear how they will leave the body after use, but a team of researchers led by Jinxing Li is trying to create a biodegradable version.

This is not the first attempt to develop “nanoswimmers” for drug transport. The majority of earlier studies used helical propellers inspired by the corkscrew tails of bacteria, but the propulsive movement of nanofish has proven more effective.|2016-09-11 19:06:54|11

Brook had jumped up two weight classes from welterweight, where he held the IBF world title, to face Golovkin for his WBC, IBF, and IBO middleweight world championships.

Golovkin dominated the opening exchanges, backing Brook onto the ropes with a series of vicious shots that caused damage under the challenger’s right eye. The British boxer survived the onslaught, however and landed a sweet straight left that visibly rattled Golovkin.

Golovkin kept up the pressure in the second, refusing to allow Brook to settle, but a superb uppercut stunned GGG and the Sheffield man ended the round on top.

Clearly stung by Brook’s impudence, Golovkin stormed out of the blocks in the third, unleashing a string of body shots that seemed to take the wind out of his opponent.

To his credit, Brook battled back and caught Golovkin with some quick sharp shots from unorthodox angles. The Kazakh was clearly frustrated and just missed with a punch right at the bell.

Brook tried to take the fight to Golovkin in the fourth, but the 34-year-old’s superior strength was beginning to tell, and he hit back with some ferocious shots.

The fifth round continued in the same vein, with Golovkin pushing Brook onto the ropes with a series of punishing left hooks.

Brook’s face started to show some serious signs of damage, with TV pundits speculating whether he had suffered a broken eye-socket.

Golovkin continued to pour forward and, with Brook looking increasingly weary, his trainer Dominic Ingle eventually caught the referee’s attention by waving the towel to save his man from further punishment.

Golovkin paid tribute to Brook after the fight for his bravery in trying to bridge the size difference between the two fighters.

“I knew that Kell was a very good fighter, but he’s not a middleweight,” said Golovkin.

“I respect him, because he is very good, but he’s not so strong. He didn’t hurt me at all. There were a lot of punches, but I didn’t feel them. I respect Kell. And thanks to his corner.

“I’m a boxer. So now I want a unification fight. I would absolutely come back to the UK to fight, and I would like to fight Billy-Joe Saunders for his belt. But I am open to everybody,” the victor said.

Brook appeared to be devastated by the loss of his own unbeaten record and expressed unhappiness with his mentor’s decision to pull him out of the fight.

“He can obviously punch, but I expected him to be a bigger puncher,” said Brook.

“In the second round he broke my eye-socket, but I was seeing three or four of him so it became very difficult.

“I was settling into it and throwing some good punches, but when you’re seeing three or four, it is hard.

“Believe me, I hurt him. When you’re in a fight I see every moment, and I saw his legs buckle a couple of times.

“But I hurt him. I take nothing away from him because he’s a scary champion, but I would like to fight him again. My eye stopped me coming forward.

“I am a warrior and I wanted to carry on. You would have to kill me to take me out.

“I was starting to get into it, but we knew how hard the first few rounds were going to be. So you will have to talk to my coach to understand that.”

A post-fight scan confirmed Brook’s fears, and he will undergo an operation to repair the damaged eye socket on Monday.|2016-09-11 19:09:10|8

First half goals by Kevin de Bruyne and Kelechi Iheanacho put Pep Guardiola's side in total control as they dominated United for most of the first half by showing greater quality on the ball.

Zlatan Ibrahimovic handed Jose Mourinho's team a lifeline just before the break with a very well taken finish, but City held firm in the face of an aerial onslaught in the second-half to maintain their unbeaten start to the season.

Mourinho gave Jesse Lingard and Henrikh Mkhitaryan their first starts of the season, but both were replaced at half-time after failing to make an impression.

Marcus Rashford's second-half introduction sparked United into life, but they failed to capitalize on a shaky performance by City goalkeeper Claudio Bravo. 

The Chilean’s addition to the team has seen England stopper Joe Hart allowed to leave the club for Italian team Torino, and Bravo has endured a torrid trolling on Twitter since. Nevertheless manager Guardiola said he was happy with his new man's efforts.

&quot;Second half we knew they changed system and with these long balls they are much more strong than us,&quot; he said.

&quot;With these long balls anything can happen, but Nico (Otamendi) in particular was fantastic.

&quot;We played good. We won the ball back quickly and created a lot of chances, but when you have that many chances to counter attack against a team like Manchester United you have to take advantage.

&quot;Claudio's performance was one of the best I've ever seen. He continued playing after a difficult first half.

&quot;His personality means a lot - how you react after making a mistake is so important.&quot;

The defeat ended United's 100 percent start to the league campaign and Mourinho admitted after the game he made a mistake with team the wrong team.

&quot;I think in the first half they were much better than us,&quot; said Mourinho.

&quot;We start the game with lots of players below their normal level. You need to be sharp, the way you think, the way you play. We had a few players below that and we paid for it.

&quot;The second half was much better. When they played Fernando after a couple of minutes it was because they felt what everyone else was feeling - that we were in control.

&quot;Honestly, I had two or three players in the first half that I wouldn't have picked if I could look back at it. They didn't give me what I want. It's their fault, it's my fault.&quot;


In the day’s other football derby, Celtic played Rangers in the first Old Firm league clash for four years since Rangers’ promotion to the Scottish Premiership. A hat-trick from Moussa Dembele and goals from Scott Sinclair and Stuart Armstrong gave the hosts a 5-1 win at Celtic Park.

&quot;The second half was much better. When they played Fernando after a couple of minutes it was because they felt what everyone else was feeling - that we were in control.

&quot;Honestly, I had two or three players in the first half that I wouldn't have picked if I could look back at it. They didn't give me what I want. It's their fault, it's my fault.&quot;


In the day’s other football derby, Celtic played Rangers in the first Old Firm league clash for four years since Rangers’ promotion to the Scottish Premiership. A hat-trick from Moussa Dembele and goals from Scott Sinclair and Stuart Armstrong gave the hosts a 5-1 win at Celtic Park.

|13|12yo Irish boy takes on social media bullies - and 500k viewers now have his back (VIDEO)|“The Bully,” a film written and directed by a 12-year-old Irish boy now living in the suburbs of Chicago, has been acclaimed a “work of art” and garnered over half a million views online.|“The Bully,” a film written and directed by a 12-year-old Irish boy now living in the suburbs of Chicago, has been acclaimed a “work of art” and garnered over half a million views online.
Jonah Maxwell, who moved from Ireland to Illinois in 2011, says he made the film to show how bullying has worsened over the past number of years due to the proliferation of social media.

Jonah, who attends school in St Charles, west of the country’s third biggest city, says the film’s contents are mainly based on experiences his friends have told him about, but admitted he too was bullied on one occasion in elementary school.

In the six-minute video, which has clocked up over 540,000 views, children detail what they’ve experienced at the hands of “faceless bullies,” ranging from exclusion, name calling, body shaming, emotional and physical abuse, and rumors being spread about them online.

“My dad told me when he was a kid, bullying would stop at 3:30 every day after school. I told him it’s not like that anymore – they can get you 24/7,” Jonah said.

“Bullying can be physical, sexual, verbal or emotional. In 2016 it is almost impossible to know how much of this goes on after school on Facebook, Twitter, Kik, Poke, Whisper, Tumblr, Vine or Instagram,” he says in the film.

Jonah’s father is a filmmaker and helped his son edit the film, while his mother, Jennifer, helped choreograph parts of the film, which has now been shown in numerous schools in the US, Brazil, Ireland and Australia.

YouTubers have branded Jonah’s film as “enthralling and moving” as well as being a “work of art.”

“Should be shown at all schools,” commented user mary obrien, while ChannelRyanH wrote that they “wish every kid in the world could see this.”

“The Bully is a work of genius, Mr. Jonah Maxwell. Bravo and thank you,” wrote Stella Quick.|2016-09-11 19:14:21|12
